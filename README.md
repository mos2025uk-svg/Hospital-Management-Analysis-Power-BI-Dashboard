# Hospital-Management-Analysis-Power-BI-Dashboard
This project presents a comprehensive Hospital Management Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard provides a 360-degree view of hospital operations by analyzing patient flow, doctor performance, disease trends, and financial metrics.
The goal of this project is to support hospital management and healthcare decision-makers with data-driven insights that improve operational efficiency, resource allocation, and overall patient care quality.

Business Objectives

Analyze patient count by doctor specialization and hospital department

Track disease trends and frequency across different demographics

Evaluate payment mode distribution including UPI, Cash, Card, and Insurance

Measure total hospital revenue and state-wise contribution

Identify operational bottlenecks and opportunities for optimization

Enable data-driven decision-making for hospital leadership

Key Insights

Cardiology and General Medicine departments have the highest patient inflow

UPI and Insurance are the most frequently used payment modes

Seasonal patterns show increased admissions during flu and infection cycles

State-wise analysis highlights top contributors to hospital revenue

Doctor specialization insights help balance workload and improve patient experience
